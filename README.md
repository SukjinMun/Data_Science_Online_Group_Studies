## 1. Web Crawling
Web crawling is the automated process by which a computer program, known as a crawler or spider, systematically browses the internet to index and collect information from web pages. These crawlers navigate through websites, following hyperlinks to gather data, such as content, URLs, metadata, and more. Search engines like Google use web crawling to index web pages, enabling users to find relevant information through search queries.

## 2. Data Analysis
Structured procedures and methodologies are essential in data analysis, comprising processes, methods, tools, techniques, templates, and outcomes for easy application. Various methodologies exist, including traditional ones like KDD and CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). CRISP-DM is a widely used data mining methodology that establishes standard procedures for extracting meaning from data across industries.

CRISP-DM Steps:
1. Business Understanding: Understanding the purpose and requirements of the analysis, setting initial project plans, and aligning with stakeholders' objectives.
2. Data Understanding: Collecting and comprehending data attributes, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and assessing data quality to ensure alignment with analysis objectives.
3. Data Preparation: Organizing data suitable for analysis techniques and preparing it for modeling.
4. Machine Learning: Employing algorithms to recognize patterns in data, often categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning, and separating datasets for training and testing.
5. Modeling: Selecting, optimizing, and evaluating various modeling techniques and algorithms while guarding against overfitting.
6. Evaluation: Assessing whether the modeling results align with project goals, typically using different evaluation metrics.
7. Deployment: Applying the finalized model in practical settings, monitoring its performance, and planning for maintenance.

Regression Model:
Regression analysis examines the relationship between two variables, often used to predict numerical values. Algorithms like k-nearest neighbor, linear regression, or multiple regression can be employed.

CRISP-DM-Based Data Analysis (Bike Sharing Dataset):
Understanding the bike sharing industry domain, focusing on bike rentals, and inferring business success based on the available bike count. Analyzing customer usage patterns based on time, date, weather conditions, and user information between 2011 and 2012.
