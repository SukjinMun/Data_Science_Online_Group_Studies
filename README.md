This repository focuses on three key topics. First, I examine web crawling, showing how crawlers and spiders are used to systematically collect data for indexing and analysis from web pages. Furthermore, I present a comprehensive data analysis methodology, including CRISP-DM steps, encompassing data preparation, machine learning, and regression modeling, particularly applied to insightful analyses of bike-sharing datasets. In addition, I utilize Smart Factory sensor data and bike-sharing usage statistics to optimize resource allocation in the bike rental business through machine learning, emphasizing alignment with business goals, mastery of Explainable AI, and utilization of diverse datasets such as Smart Factory sensor data.

## 1. Web Crawling
Web crawling is the automated process by which a computer software called a crawler or spider browses the internet in order to index and collect information from online sites. These crawlers navigate websites, following hyperlinks to collect data such as content, URLs, metadata, and other information. online crawling is used by search engines like Google to index online pages, allowing users to access relevant information through search queries.

## 2. Data Analysis

Structured procedures and methodologies, which include processes, methods, tools, techniques, templates, and outcomes for easy implementation, are vital in data analysis. There are several approaches available, including older ones such as KDD and CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). CRISP-DM is a widely used data mining methodology that sets industry-wide standard procedures for extracting meaning from data.

CRISP-DM Procedures:
1. Business Understanding: Understanding the purpose and requirements of the analysis, developing preliminary project plans, and aligning with the objectives of stakeholders.
2. Data Understanding entails gathering and comprehending data properties, doing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and reviewing data quality to ensure alignment with analytical objectives.
3. Data Preparation: Organizing and preparing data for analysis techniques and modeling.
4. Machine Learning: The use of algorithms to recognize patterns in data, which is generally divided into supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as the separation of datasets for training and testing.
5. Modeling: Choosing, optimizing, and assessing different modeling techniques and algorithms while avoiding overfitting.
6. assessment: Using several assessment measures, determine whether the modeling findings fit with project goals.
7. Deployment: Putting the finalized model into action and monitoring its performance.

Regression Model:
Regression analysis investigates the relationship between two variables, which is frequently used to forecast numerical values. You can use algorithms like k-nearest neighbor, linear regression, or multiple regression.

CRISP-DM-Based Data Analysis (Bike Sharing Dataset):
Understanding the bike sharing industry domain, focusing on bike rentals, and inferring business success based on the available bike count. Analyzing customer usage patterns based on time, date, weather conditions, and user information between 2011 and 2012.
